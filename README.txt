Contained within this repository is a small function for linear 
regression. The GNU Scientific Library's implementation of such 
a thing is most likely better than mine, but that is rather 
large library that you may not wish to bundle just to use one 
function. Additionally, you may not wish to use the GPL.

Read the comment inside the source code to understand how to use 
the function.
